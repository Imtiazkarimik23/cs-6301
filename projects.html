  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    In this semester-long project, students will conduct research on network or systems
    security in teams of 1–2 people under the instructor's supervision. All teams and
    project topics must be approved by the instructor. The outcome of this project will
    be similar to a conference-style paper of at most 10 pages, in which you build an
    argument for studying the open research problems you advocate investigating—identifying
    why the problem is important and why it is solvable in the near future. The grade will
    be based on novelty, depth, correctness, rigor of execution, clarity of presentation,
    and effort.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Theme</h2>
  <p>
    “Thinking like an adversary” is critical to understanding (1) the current security and
    privacy posture of a system, (2) how existing security policies can be broken, and
    (3) how to enforce stronger and more robust security policies. Accordingly, each
    project should align with the theme of <strong>security analysis of an existing system</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The overarching goal is to design and implement a systematic security evaluation
    framework using program analysis, software testing, formal verification, and applied
    cryptography. Each project consists of two parts, each with multiple milestones.
  </p>

  <h2>Part 1 – Reproducing an Existing Attack</h2>
  <p>
    As the first step, you will reproduce a known attack on an existing system. Your task
    is to understand a known vulnerability and its corresponding attack and write an
    original exploit. You may not contact the paper authors for exploits or use
    pre-packaged attack tools. However, you may use open-source, general-purpose tools
    (e.g., gdb, Wireshark, packet sniffers) and scripts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some vulnerabilities may have been fixed in newer software or libraries (e.g., Linux,
    TCP, TLS), so you may need to target older versions.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to the course ethics policy, you must not test attacks against systems owned
    by others. All attacks must be conducted against your own isolated device, machine,
    or virtual machine.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will present a demo showing (1) the vulnerability, (2) how it can be exploited,
    and (3) the implications of the attack. You will also explain how you implemented the
    exploit, set up the attack environment, and the technical challenges encountered.
  </p>

  <h2>Part 2 – Project Extensions</h2>
  <p>
    Based on insights gained from Part 1, you may extend your project in one or more of
    the following directions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify a new attack on the same system or protocol.</li>
    <li>Design a systematic security analysis framework using formal verification, static or dynamic analysis, fuzzing, or other testing techniques.</li>
    <li>Propose verified or high-assurance defenses.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Project Topics</h2>
  <p>
    Students are encouraged to consult recent proceedings from top security venues,
    including IEEE Security &amp; Privacy (Oakland), ACM CCS, NDSS, and USENIX Security.
    Relevant work can also be found at Black Hat and DEF CON.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
  <p>
    The proposal must not exceed two pages (including references). Use the ACM Overleaf
    template for all project-related submissions.
  </p>

  <h3>Proposal Components</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>What (Problem Statement):</strong> Project title, team member contact
      details, problem statement, goals, and the specific attack(s) to be reproduced.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Why (Motivation):</strong> Importance of the problem, relevant prior work,
      and why the vulnerability is critical and difficult to detect manually.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>How (Design / Implementation):</strong> Resources required, plans for Part 2,
      related codebases, and evaluation criteria (e.g., effectiveness, efficiency).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Workload:</strong> Task distribution among team members and milestones for
      Part 1.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Report</h2>
  <p>

    paper. Typical sections include Abstract, Introduction, Background, Design Overview,
    Design Details, Implementation, Evaluation, Discussion and Limitations, Related Work,
    and Conclusion and Future Work.

    solutions are insufficient, present your proposal and intuitions, and summarize
    high-level results.
  </p>
